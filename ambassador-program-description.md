# The Open Organization Project

## Our Vision

The Open Organization project is a community dedicated to exploring how open principles change the ways we work, manage, and lead.

Our community members study and share strategies for building organizational cultures on principles like transparency, adaptability, collaboration, inclusivity, and community.

## Our Commitments

We're committed to:

- **Learning.** We're researching open source values so we can better understand how they're influencing today's innovative organizational cultures, and we're always refining the "open organization" concept, differentiating or distinguishing it from seemingly similar approaches to management and leadership.
- **Helping.** We're a trusted resource for anyone interested in leveraging the power of open principles to improve their organizations.
- **Translating.** We explain community-specific vocabularies to general audiences seeking to understand the benefits of an open approach to management and leadership.
- **Engaging.** We draw others into productive dialogues and exploratory activities that illuminate the benefits of applying open thinking to organizational contexts.

## Our Methods

We do all this by:

- Publishing articles, books, and other resources exploring the nature of openness in contemporary organizations
- Exhibiting and speaking at industry and community-focused events
- Connecting with and interviewing innovative leaders, managers, and practitioners innovating in an open manner
- Maintaining a repository of high-quality, immediately accessible, vetted resources anyone can use to implement open principles in their teams or organizations

Contributors can become ambassadors by nominating themselves or receiving a nomination from an Open Organization Ambassador in good standing. In the case of self-nomination, the contributor should open a GitHub issue in the repository containing this document. In the case of nomination by an acting Ambassador, the Ambassador should open the issue. In either case, the issue should clearly outline the nominee's history of contributions to the project and explain the nominee's interest in deepening they're investment in the community.

The community will discuss the nomination for a period of no more than 72 hours. During that time, current Ambassadors can offer their support for the nomination of raise objections to it.

A nomination receiving "net-positive" support from at least three current Ambassadors is approved. This means that:

- if a nomination receives approval from three Ambassadors, it is approved
- if a nomination receives approval from four Ambassadors, and an objection from one, it is approved
- and so on

Ambassadors pledge a minimum commitment of one year. At the conclusion of their respective terms, ambassadors will discuss plans to renew or complete their commitments.

Ambassadors who hold that position for at least one year and leave the program in good standing are eligible for emeritus status. Ambassadors Emeriti receive all benefits supporters and contributors do, as well as:
