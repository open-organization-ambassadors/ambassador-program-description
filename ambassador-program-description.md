# The Open Organization Ambassadors Program at Opensource.com

## Our Vision

We are the Open Organization Ambassadors, a group of Opensource.com community members dedicated to teaching others about the ways open source principles can enhance (and ultimately reshape) organizational cultures.

We write about, discuss, and evangelize organizational cultures predicated on transparency, adaptability, collaboration, inclusivity, and community.

## Our Commitments

We're committed to:

* **Learning.** We're researching open source values so we can better understand how they're influencing today's innovative organizational cultures, and we're always refining the "open organization" concept, differentiating or distinguishing it from seemingly similar approaches to management and leadership.

* **Helping.** We're a trusted resource for anyone interested in leveraging the power of open principles to improve their organizations.

* **Translating.** We explain community-specific vocabularies to general audiences seeking to understand the benefits of an open approach to management and leadership.

* **Engaging.** We draw others into productive dialogues and exploratory activities that illuminate the benefits of applying open thinking to organizational contexts.

## Our Methods

We do all this by:

* Publishing informative and exploratory articles on the nature of openness in contemporary organizations

* Speaking at industry and community-focused events

* Connecting with and interviewing innovative leaders, managers, and practitioners innovating in an open manner

* Maintaining a repository of high-quality, immediately accessible, and vetted resources anyone can use to implement open principles in their teams or organizations

## Our Members

To discuss your participation in the ambassador community, just contact the [Opensource.com staff](https://opensource.com/contact) or and [open organization ambassador](https://github.com/open-organization-ambassadors/). Of course, current members can—and do—nominate potential participants.

Our community consists of members from a wide variety of backgrounds—people from any number of different of domains who possess varying levels of experience and technical proficiencies. Successful ambassadors need simply:

* Consider themselves champions of [open values and principles](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition),

* Care about the ways those values can help create better organizational experiences for everyone, and

* Enjoy working productively with others who feel the same way.
